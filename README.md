# EmberHeart Kernel for OnePlus 11

## Your warranty is no longer valid!

I am not responsible for bricked devices, dead SD cards, thermonuclear war, or the current economic crisis. Please do some research if you have any concerns about features included in this kernel before flashing it! YOU are choosing to make these modifications, and if you point your finger at me for messing up your device, I will laugh at you.
